# ðŸ’¼ Research & Work Experience

### **GlobalFoundries**   
*Data Scientist Intern (May 2025 â€“ Dec 2025)*  
**Research Focus: Intelligent Data Engineering for Scalable Analysis and Visual ML**

**Project 1: Scalable Trace Data Pipeline & Compression for Semiconductor Analytics**  
- Designed and optimized modular pipelines using **AWS S3**, **Boto3**, and **PySpark** for multi-month trace data retrieval and analysis.  
- Investigated and deployed **Parquet + Snappy compression** techniques to enhance computational efficiency and data fidelity.  
- Achieved major scalability milestones: extraction time reduced from hours to **4â€“8 mins**, storage reduced by **up to 90%**, and eliminated memory crashes on large-scale workloads.

**Project 2: Trace-to-Image Machine Learning Pipeline**  
- Conducted a literature survey and pilot study on **time-series-to-image** conversion and **visual classification** for semiconductor trace data.  
- Developed a multi-phase pipeline converting segmented traces into images (e.g., **Gramian Angular Fields**, line charts), followed by **RNN baseline model** training and hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna** and **Keras-Tuner**.  
- Delivered a reproducible ML pipeline with **â‰¥5% accuracy improvement**, validated through internal presentations and journal deliverables.
